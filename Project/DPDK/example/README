Assumptions:
- All traffic is sent/received through a single DPDK physical port and using a single queue.
- All measurements are reported as an average of 5 independent runs (unless stated otherwise).
- We use a packet size of 1KB, and the maximum allowed packet size is around 1500 as Ethernet has an MTU of 1500. Packet sizes higher than 1500 failed to transmit/receive.
- We use a static TCP window size of 50 for our experiments. We assume no packets are dropped and do not handle retransmissions.
