Assumptions:
1. Packets processed at egress queues are used to calculate link utilization instead of ingress.
2. Both To and From tables are updated when a packet is recieved at destination tor.
3. ECMP hashing is computed using hash_fn(src || dst) to have a deterministic value. 


Steps:
To run the experiment (modify the flow distribution)
```
./runner.sh
```

Once the experiments are finished, to parse the generated logs (for result calculation)
```
./parse_results.sh <log dir> <result dir>
```
